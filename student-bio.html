            <p>I recently decided to make a career change after working in the finance industry for half a decade. A
                big reason
                for my change was due to the work-life balance being difficult to get right for me. I have also
                served in the Army
                as a Command Systems Operator in the Artillery Core, studied at the Adelaide Conservatory of Music
                and half finished
                a Bachelors degree in Commerce (Corporate Finance) and Science (Geology) - always happy to trade
                stories over a
                beer.</p>
            <p>After some soul searching and introspective career defining during COVID19, I decided to make the
                jump - and learn to become a programmer.</p>
